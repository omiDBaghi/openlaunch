## What a launch does
1. deploys a fixed-supply ERC-20 (1,000,000,000; no mint/pause/blacklist/tax/owner)
2. initializes a Uniswap v4 pool quote/token (quote = ETH, GITLAWB, USDG on Robinhood Chain, USDC on Arc, or a registry stock token; tick spacing 200, no hook) at the chosen start tick
3. mints one single-sided position holding 100% of supply to an ownerless locker (no withdraw path exists)
4. registers fee routing: lpFee 0 | 10000 (1%) | 30000 (3%) pips; recipients [] = fees burned,
   else {payout,bps}[] summing to 10000. Fixed forever.
Anyone may call locker.collect(tokenId): accrued fees are paid straight to recipients (or burned).

## Launch (contract call)
factory.launch((name, symbol, metadataURI, quote, supply=0, startTick, lpFee, salt, recipients))
startTick 184200 ≈ 10 ETH FDV for 1B supply (raw price = 1.0001^tick token-wei per quote unit; for USDG or USDC use ~391400 ≈ $10k FDV).
ERC20 quote: token must sort above the quote address → call factory.findSalt(launcher, baseSalt, name, symbol, 0, metadataURI, quote, 64) first.
Optional metadata: POST ${SITE_URL}/api/launch/meta {chain, launcher, salt, name, symbol, description?, image_url?, website?, x_handle?} → {uri, token}; pass uri as metadataURI. x_handle takes a handle (foo, @foo) or an x.com / twitter.com profile link; the bare handle is stored.
Recommended: buy a little right after launch (a Universal Router swap on the new pool; the site's form suggests ≈ $25). A token with no
holder and no price move reads as dead on screeners and sits under "quiet launches" on the home page until an outside wallet trades it.

## API
- GET  ${SITE_URL}/api/launch/list?chain=base|robinhood|arc&sort=live|new|mcap|volume|gainers|holders&window=1h|24h|all&limit=50
  sort=live (the home page default; "trending" is an alias): tokens an outside wallet traded in the last 24h first, ranked by outside
  wallets this hour, then today, then the last outside trade; then each launcher's newest launch under 1h old; then quiet launches, one
  row per launcher; both by age. "Outside" = not the launcher and not a swap in the sniper window (launch block + 3; a sell there can
  only be a sniper's). Rows carry traders_1h_ex / traders_24h_ex
  (those counts), last_outside_trade_at, live_tier (live|new|quiet, live sort only) and launcher_collapsed.
